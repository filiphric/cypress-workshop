# ⭐ Hodnotenia workshopu

Mám šťastie na skvelých účastníkov svojich workshopov, ktorí vždy vedia poskytnúť podnety, ktoré ma posúvajú vpred. Verím, že práve ich feedback robí každé workshopove stretnutie lepším. Pár hodnotení účastníkov:

> _Filip Hric was really great, he had prepared couple of great examples to show how to use Cypress and with live example of it's benefits \(I really loved network requests - stubbing routes\). He also had some great tips for better integration with IDE, nice slides. Everything was clear to me and really entertaining!_  
> **– Ján H.**

> _Excellent intro to e2e testing with cypress_  
> **– Lukáš P.**

> _He was well prepared - he had awesome slides with all necessary information and an example project where we were filling in only parts of the code. He was very talkative, nice, happy to explain whatever we were curious about._
